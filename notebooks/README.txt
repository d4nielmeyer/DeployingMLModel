To make the site available on the web, we can create a container and host it on AWS:
- flask-demo.zip contains all the files needed to create the container
- create the docker image
- host the container online and get the public IP
- in sentiment.html, update the URL with the public IP
- use AWS file hosting services to host sentiment.html 
- open the file URL and change https:// to http:/
